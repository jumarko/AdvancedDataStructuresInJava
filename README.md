Repository containing examples from course "Advanced Data Structures in Java": https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures.

The are two main sub-directories:
* UCSDGraphs - contains code provided by course and updated in scope of programming assignments
* advanced-data-structures-in-java - contains my original code; typically just examples and my implementation of algorithms presented in lectures.
